### How to view trace link 

You can view it via Restful API

```javascript
curl http://127.0.0.1:7002/trace?appName=my-site # my-site 是您的应用名
```

It can also be viewed through GUI Dashboard, [check docs](../other/dashboard.html).



### about sampling rate

Default sampling rate is:

```javascript
{
  rate: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' ? 100 : 10,
  // If the trace with the highest priority is out of the sample rate limit,
  // such as a wrong trace.
  priority: true 
}
```

Production environment is 10%, otherwise 100%.

That can be changed via global config, [docs](../base/global_config.html).
